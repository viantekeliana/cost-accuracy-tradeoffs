# cost-accuracy-tradeoffs
Small, focused experiments exploring the relationship between:  inference cost  verification depth  accuracy thresholds   The goal is to better understand how bounded verification and human‑in‑the‑loop checks can reduce compute usage while maintaining acceptable performance for non‑critical applications.  This is not a production system. Seismic!🤔
